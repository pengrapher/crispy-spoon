      <description>&lt;p&gt;I switch between a 2021 M1 Macbook Pro, and a Windows 11 desktop daily. Not wanting to use headphones exclusively, I do prefer having some sound piped out on some sort of speakers. I&amp;rsquo;d been using an inexpensive Dell monitor soundbar and was content. With a new monitor, I looked at a larger replacement. For a time, with the Mac I played through separate bluetooth speakers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After some months passed, I settled on the Sonos Ray. Unfortunately, the Ray has only one optical input; no HDMI, line-in or USB-A, unlike the old Dell soundbar. For a Windows PC, that was fine. For the Mac, I needed a different solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
