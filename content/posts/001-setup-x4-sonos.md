title: 'Desktop audio - Mac and Windows switching with the Sonos Ray soundbar'
---

I switch daily between a 2021 M1 MacBook Pro and a Windows 11 desktop. I prefer quality sound without relying solely on headphones. At first, I used a modest Dell monitor soundbar. But when I got a new monitor, I wanted something better. For a while, I tried separate Bluetooth speakers with my Mac, but then I decided to invest in the Sonos Ray.

The Ray sounds great, but it has a major drawback: it only has one optical input and no HDMI, line-in, or USB-A connections. That made it tricky to connect to my Mac, so I needed a different solution.

## The quest for the right DAC

After some research, I knew I needed some kind of external USB DAC; one with an optical out. Although choices for external USB DACs are plentiful today, from Sennheiser, IFI, to FIIO, a DAC with an optical out reduced the choices quickly. The reason this isn't common, is because most manufacturers expect you to use the DAC to convert your digital streams and channel them to an analog output like a speaker over a line-in cable. I was using my DAC more like a *transport*.

I came to realize that most desktop DACs have optical in and analog out, but there are very few with both an optical in and optical out. 

I kept coming back to the Creative external DAC offerings; a brand name that pioneered the market for computer soundcards from the early days of the PC. I ended up choosing the Creative X4 external USB DAC. To switch audio between my Mac and desktop, I added a USB switcher with four inputs and two outputs.

Having a headphone jack on the desk was a nice to have. In a pinch, it made it very convenient to route longer wired monitoring headphone cables out of the way when editing videos. A Shure USB audio interface, with an XLR microphone, which I used, didn't have any optical output. 

I've been using this setup for the last 12 months. It has been working flawlessly.


### The ubiquity of DACs today - standalone DACs vs embedded DACs
This whole exercise got me thinking, reading and learning more about DACs and how they are used today; how pervasive they are today, even if we don't always think about in terms of buying a dedicated soundcard or 'DAC' today. For example, mobile phones, bluetooth speakers, wireless earbuds all have DAC chips built-in.  

DACs are used in converting the digital bits to the analog signals that speakers can play as audible sound. A DAC or digital-to-analogue converter isn't something we explicitly go out and buy.  

DACs don't need to be in the form factor of a Sound Blaster card that was traditionally added to desktop computers in the 1990s. Neither does it have to be visible in the form of a hundred dollar hifi rack component.

My journey for the right DAC has deepened my appreciation of how the sound reaches my ears.
