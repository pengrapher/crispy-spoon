Working with long documents in a word processor doesn't need to be difficult. Navigation becomes much easier, which is one of the challenges of longer documents. 

This applies regardless if you are working in Microsoft Word, Apple Pages or Google Docs. 

## Apply styles for formatting

Instead of formatting individual lines, apply some structure by applying built-in heading styles.

**Microsoft Word**

Heading 1 - CTRL + ALT + 1

Heading 2 - CTRL + ALT + 2

Heading 3 - CTRL + ALT + 3


**Apple Pages**

Apply heading style from the Styles drop down. Alternatively, you can create equivalent keyboard shortcuts for each of the heading styles.

Heading

Heading 2

Heading 3

**Google Docs**

Select the Heading 1 style from the panel.

Heading 1 - CMD + OPT + 1 

Heading 2 - CMD + OPT + 1 

Heading 3 - CMD + OPT + 1 

## Use the document outline view
The document view not only helps you organize your document structure, it helps you jump between sections.

In Google Docs, the document outline shows by default.

In Microsoft Word, the outline might be hidden. In the ribbon pane, click **View > Navigation**.

In Pages, from the toolbar, click **View** and select **Table of Contents**.
