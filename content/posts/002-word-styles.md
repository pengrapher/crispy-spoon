Working with long documents in a word processor don't need to be difficult. This applies regardless if you are working in Microsoft Word, Apple Pages or Google Docs. 


For the first line of the document, apply a Heading 1 style. This is irrespective of the word processor you choose to use.

**Microsoft Word**
CTRL+ALT+1 - for Heading 1
CTRL+ALT+2 - for Heading 2


**Apple Pages**
Apply heading style from the Styles panel.
Heading
Heading 2
Heading 3

**Google Docs**
Select the Heading 1 style from the panel.
